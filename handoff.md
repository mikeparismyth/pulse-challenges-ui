# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: January 2025
- Current Phase: Phase 4.4 Complete - Transaction Signing Flows & HTML Validation
- Last Updated: September 11, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 4 Steps Only)
- **Transaction Signing Modal Implementation**: Created comprehensive TransactionSigningModals component with pixel-perfect wallet-specific flows (Abstract, MetaMask, Pulse) matching reference designs
- **Wallet Flow Routing Logic**: Implemented smart routing that directs connected wallets to transaction signing vs unconnected wallets to connection flows based on wallet state
- **HTML Validation Fixes**: Resolved React hydration errors by eliminating nested button elements in payment method selection and terms sections
- **Production Build Verification**: Confirmed clean TypeScript compilation, zero console errors, and successful Bolt hosting deployment with all flows functional

## Current Foundation
Complete end-to-end tournament platform with dual wallet flows: connection for new wallets and transaction signing for connected wallets. Users experience seamless wallet state management with proper routing between connection and transaction modals. All HTML validation errors resolved, React hydration warnings eliminated, and production deployment verified working.

## Next Priority
Complete Phase 4 advanced features: enhanced admin tools for challenge creation, comprehensive account settings page with wallet management, mobile optimization and gaming polish effects, real-time leaderboard updates integration.

## Integration Points for Engineers
- **Dual Modal System**: Clean separation between WalletConnectionModals and TransactionSigningModals ready for Privy SDK integration
- **Wallet State Routing**: Smart flow detection based on getConnectedWallet() status for seamless UX transitions  
- **Transaction Interfaces**: Complete mock transaction flows ready for real blockchain integration (Abstract L2, MetaMask, embedded wallets)
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with proper TypeScript interfaces for easy API replacement
- **Static Export Ready**: Optimized build pipeline configured for Vercel deployment

## Technical Achievements
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.15 LTS (secure, performant, stable)
- **Wallet Flows**: Complete connection + transaction signing modals with wallet-specific UX patterns
- **HTML Compliance**: Zero validation errors, clean React hydration, production-ready code
- **Build System**: Clean TypeScript compilation, optimized static export, verified deployment
- **State Management**: Single source of truth pattern with proper prop sharing between components

## Known Issues
- All authentication and wallet connections are mocked (interfaces ready for Privy integration)
- Tournament data is static mock data (TypeScript interfaces defined for backend APIs)
- No real blockchain transactions (complete UI flows established for easy integration)
- No real-time updates (component structure ready for WebSocket/real-time features)
