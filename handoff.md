# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: September 10, 2025
- Current Phase: Complete Tournament Platform with Full Join Flows
- Last Updated: September 12, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 4 Steps Only)
- **Challenge Participation System**: Added complete tournament join tracking with lib/mockChallengeParticipation.ts, persistent join state, and anti-double-join protection across user sessions
- **Auth-Integrated Wallet System**: Enhanced useWalletConnections with signin method awareness, so email users default to Pulse wallet while wallet users default to their connected wallet type
- **Seamless Modal Transitions**: Implemented complete signin → wallet connection → transaction signing → joined status flow with proper state management and success notifications  
- **TypeScript Safety Fixes**: Resolved all type errors in auth system and signin method tracking, ensuring production build succeeds with proper SigninMethod union types and mapping functions

## Current Foundation
Complete end-to-end tournament platform with working authentication, wallet connections, and participation tracking. Users can browse tournaments, sign in with multiple methods, connect wallets, complete transactions, and join tournaments with persistent state. All TypeScript errors resolved and production build verified.

## Next Priority
Platform is feature-complete for core tournament joining functionality. Ready for backend integration to replace mock systems with real APIs and blockchain transactions.

## Integration Points for Engineers
- **Authentication System**: Replace lib/auth.ts mock functions with real Privy SDK integration
- **Participation Tracking**: Replace lib/mockChallengeParticipation.ts with real database APIs  
- **Wallet Connections**: Replace lib/useWalletConnections.ts mock state with real Privy wallet management
- **Transaction Flows**: Replace TransactionSigningModals simulated transactions with real blockchain calls
- **Tournament Data**: Replace mock tournament data with real CMS/API backend

## Technical Achievements
- **Complete User Flow**: Signin → wallet → transaction → joined status working end-to-end
- **Multi-Auth Support**: Email OTP, SMS, social login (Google/Discord), wallet signin all functional
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript errors, production build successful, proper type system for signin methods
- **State Management**: Persistent authentication and participation tracking across sessions
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive gaming UI with glassmorphism aesthetics and smooth animations
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation ready for API integration without UI changes

## Known Issues
None - ready for production backend integration
