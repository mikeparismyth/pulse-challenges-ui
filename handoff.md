# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: September 13, 2025
- Current Phase: Complete Wallet & Transaction System Implementation
- Current Step: (All Wallet Flows Complete) → Moving to Advanced Features & Polish
- Last Updated: September 13, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 5 Steps Only)
- **Credit/Debit Card Flow Fix**: Corrected card payments to bypass wallet connection and route directly to transaction/payment form without Connect button requirement
- **WalletConnect & Coinbase Implementation**: Added complete connection and transaction flows for WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet with proper branding and dynamic wallet configuration
- **Transaction Signing Enhancement**: Made transaction flows dynamic to support all wallet types (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase) with wallet-specific branding and colors
- **Wallet State Persistence**: Implemented localStorage-based persistence for wallet connections, ensuring connected wallets remain connected across challenge navigation and browser refresh
- **Complete Wallet System**: All wallet types (Abstract, Pulse, MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase, Credit/Debit Card) now have complete end-to-end flows from connection through transaction completion

## Current Foundation
Production-ready tournament platform with complete wallet ecosystem. All payment methods functional with proper routing, connection flows, transaction signing, and state persistence. Component architecture fully prepared for Privy integration with clear separation between UI logic and mock data layer.

## Next Priority  
**Phase 5 Advanced Features**: Tournament participation tracking, admin dashboard enhancements, real-time leaderboard updates, mobile optimization refinements

## Integration Points for Engineers
- **Mock APIs**: All wallet flows ready for Privy auth + real blockchain integration - replacement points clearly marked with "// MOCK: Replace with API call" comments
- **Component Architecture**: Modular TypeScript interfaces designed for seamless API replacement without component changes
- **Wallet Integration**: Complete dual modal system (connection + transaction) ready for real Privy wallet connections and blockchain transactions
- **State Management**: LocalStorage-based persistence ready to be replaced with Privy user state management
- **Build Pipeline**: Static export optimized for Vercel deployment with zero compilation errors

## Technical Stack Validated
- Next.js 14.2.15 LTS, TypeScript strict mode, zero compilation errors
- Complete wallet connection + transaction signing flows for all supported wallets
- HTML compliant, React hydration clean, production deployed
- LocalStorage-based state persistence working across navigation

## Wallet System Status (COMPLETE)
- **Abstract Wallet**: Connection + 2-step transaction flow (approve → transaction)
- **Pulse Wallet**: Always connected + streamlined transaction confirmation 
- **MetaMask**: Connection + mobile wallet mockup transaction flow
- **WalletConnect**: Connection + transaction flow with blue branding
- **Coinbase Wallet**: Connection + transaction flow with blue branding  
- **Credit/Debit Card**: Direct payment form (bypasses connection entirely)
- **State Persistence**: All connections persist across challenges and browser refresh

## Mock Data Integration (ENGINEER HANDOFF READY)
All mock data marked with replacement comments:
- `useWalletConnections.ts`: "// MOCK: Replace with Privy user.linkedAccounts"
- `mockWalletData.ts`: "// MOCK: Replace with real wallet state management"
- `TransactionSigningModals.tsx`: "// MOCK: Replace with real blockchain calls"
- `WalletConnectionModals.tsx`: "// MOCK: Replace with Privy connection APIs"

## Known Issues & Handoff Notes
- Authentication mocked (Privy integration interfaces ready)  
- Tournament data static (TypeScript interfaces match PRD exactly)
- No real blockchain calls (UI flows complete for integration)
- No real-time updates (WebSocket-ready component structure)
- LocalStorage used for persistence (ready for Privy user state replacement)

## Workflow Integration Active
- Claude Project configured with PRD reference and ARCHITECTURE.md
- System instructions active for production-ready guidance
- Context management templates established and maintained
- Documentation automatically updated after each development phase
