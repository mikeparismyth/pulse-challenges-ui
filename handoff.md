# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: January 2025
- Current Phase: Phase 4.3 Complete - Wallet State Management & Next.js Upgrade
- Last Updated: September 11, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 4 Steps Only)
- **Next.js Surgical Upgrade**: Successfully upgraded from 13.5.1 → 14.2.15 LTS with zero breaking changes, improved performance, and maintained static export functionality
- **Wallet State Management Fix**: Resolved wallet connection persistence issue by implementing single source of truth pattern - challenge page now shares wallet state with join modal via props
- **TypeScript Interface Alignment**: Fixed wallet connection function signatures and avatar field types for clean compilation
- **Production Deployment Verification**: Confirmed all wallet flows work correctly on live Bolt hosting deployment

## Current Foundation
Complete tournament platform with working wallet connection flows, clean Next.js 14.2.15 foundation, and verified production deployment. Users can connect wallets (Abstract, Pulse, MetaMask) with proper state persistence across modals. All TypeScript compilation errors resolved, build processes optimized, and static export functionality confirmed working.

## Next Priority
Continue with Phase 4 advanced features: enhanced admin tools, account settings page with wallet management, mobile optimization and gaming polish, real-time features integration.

## Integration Points for Engineers
- **Wallet State Management**: Clean useWalletConnections hook ready for Privy SDK replacement
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with proper prop interfaces for easy API integration
- **Static Export Ready**: Configured for Vercel deployment with optimized build pipeline
- **TypeScript Foundation**: All interfaces defined and validated for seamless backend integration
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete sign-in → wallet connection → join challenge flow ready for real APIs

## Technical Achievements
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.15 LTS (secure, performant, stable)
- **State Management**: React hooks pattern with single source of truth
- **Build System**: Clean TypeScript compilation, optimized static export
- **Deployment**: Verified working on Bolt hosting, ready for Vercel migration
- **Architecture**: Engineer-friendly codebase with clear separation of concerns

## Known Issues
- All authentication and wallet connections are mocked (ready for Privy integration)
- Tournament data is static mock data (interfaces ready for backend APIs)
- No real blockchain transactions (wallet connection flows established)
- No real-time updates (component structure ready for WebSocket integration)
