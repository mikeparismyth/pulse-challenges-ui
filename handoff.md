# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: September 13, 2025
- Current Phase: Fix Mock Data structures and wallet transaction flows for all wallets/cases
- Current Step: (Transaction Flows Complete) â†’ Moving to Advanced Features/fixes
- Last Updated: September 13, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 4 Steps Only)
- **Transaction Signing Modal Implementation**: Created comprehensive TransactionSigningModals component with pixel-perfect wallet-specific flows (Abstract, MetaMask, Pulse) matching reference designs
- **Wallet Flow Routing Logic**: Implemented smart routing that directs connected wallets to transaction signing vs unconnected wallets to connection flows based on wallet state
- **HTML Validation Fixes**: Resolved React hydration errors by eliminating nested button elements in payment method selection and terms sections
- **Production Build Verification**: Confirmed clean TypeScript compilation, zero console errors, and successful Bolt hosting deployment with all flows functional

## Current Foundation
Complete tournament platform with dual wallet flows, transaction signing, and production-ready architecture. Component structure ready for Privy integration with clean separation between UI and data layers.

## Next Priority  
**Phase 4 Advanced Features**: Enhanced admin tools, mobile optimization, gaming polish effects

## Integration Points for Engineers
- **Mock APIs**: Ready for Privy auth + Pudgy Party webhook integration
- **Component Architecture**: Modular TypeScript interfaces for API replacement
- **Wallet Integration**: Dual modal system ready for real blockchain transactions
- **Build Pipeline**: Static export optimized for Vercel deployment

## Technical Stack Validated
- Next.js 14.2.15 LTS, TypeScript strict mode, zero compilation errors
- Complete wallet connection + transaction signing flows
- HTML compliant, React hydration clean, production deployed

## Known Issues & Handoff Notes
- Authentication/wallets mocked (interfaces ready for Privy)  
- Tournament data static (TypeScript interfaces defined)
- No real blockchain calls (UI flows complete for integration)
- No real-time updates (component structure WebSocket-ready)

## New Workflow Integration
- Claude Project configured with PRD reference
- System instructions active for production-ready guidance
- Context management templates established
