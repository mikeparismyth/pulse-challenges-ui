# Pulse Challenges - Development Handoff

## Project Overview
- Started: January 2025
- Current Phase: Phase 4.1 Complete - Join Challenge Modal/Drawer System
- Last Updated: January 15, 2025

## Recently Completed (Last 4 Steps Only)
- Phase 4.1C-2: Wallet connection mockups - created Abstract, Pulse, MetaMask, and Coinbase onramp wallet connection flows with Privy-style design patterns
- Phase 4.1C: Join modal integration fixes - resolved modal state timing issues, added setTimeout for clean modal transitions, wallet flows now trigger properly
- Phase 4.1: Import fixes and debugging - resolved WalletConnectionModals import error, removed debug buttons, added toast import for proper error handling
- Phase 4.2: Auth-gated join flow - implemented Privy-style sign-in modal for unauthenticated users, replaced header sign-in with comprehensive auth flow

## Current Foundation
Complete join challenge flow with authentication gate, payment method selection, and wallet connection mockups. Users must sign in before joining challenges. Full end-to-end flow: Sign-in → Join Modal → Payment Selection → Wallet Connection → Success. All modals use gaming glassmorphism design with Privy-style UX patterns.

## Next Priority
Enhanced tab content with prize distribution breakdown, expanded leaderboard with user positioning, interactive state management with "hasJoined" toggle, and gaming polish improvements.

## Integration Points for Engineers
- Replace mock auth with real Privy React SDK integration
- Connect wallet selection to actual Privy wallet connection APIs
- Replace mock payment flows with real Abstract L2 and Solana transaction signing
- Implement real tournament join/settlement smart contract calls
- Add real user state management and persistence
- Connect challenge data to backend APIs

## Known Issues
- All authentication and wallet connections are mocked
- No real blockchain transactions or smart contract integration
- Tournament data is static mock data
- No real-time updates or WebSocket connections
