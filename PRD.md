# **Pulse Challenges — Web App POC PRD (Next.js + Privy + Abstract)**

**Owner:** Michael Paris  
**Contributors:** Product, Platform, Wallet, Data, Legal/Compliance  
**Last updated:** Sept 4, 2025  
**Status:** Draft v0.1

## **0) Executive Summary**

We will build **Pulse Challenges** as a responsive **web app** (mobile-first, desktop-ready) that we can ship rapidly, demo cleanly, and hand off to engineers for production hardening. It will use **Next.js** + **Vercel** for velocity, **Privy** for progressive auth + embedded/external wallets (EVM & Solana), and target **Abstract L2 (EVM)** first for on-chain escrow + payouts, with **Pudgy Party** as the flagship game. The app must preserve the Pulse tournament business logic (Top‑12 leaderboard, fees, low‑participation rules) and add multi‑token/multi‑network selection for entry/payouts (MYTH on Abstract; PENGU on Abstract and/or Solana; admin‑addable tokens).

Key differences from the prior MVP:

- **Wallet & Auth:** Replace Turnkey with Privy (embedded wallets, social/OTP, external wallet linking; key export enabled for non‑custodial UX).  

- **Chain:** Target **Abstract (EVM)** and later Solana for escrow/payouts  

- **Contracts:** Integrate a **third‑party tournament escrow provider (TEP)** or ship an interim audited EVM contract (escrow + fee splits) while we evaluate multi‑chain options.  

- **Game:** Spec for **Pudgy Party** leaderboard modes (i.e. Top‑1/Top‑3/Top‑10 Finishes, Coins Earned, etc.).  

- **Admin‑gated creation:** Challenge creation initially restricted to admins; designed to unlock UGC later.  

- **Analytics:** Snowplow + Looker with a clean event schema from auth → join → play → payout.  

## **1) Goals & Non‑Goals**

### **1.1 Goals**

- Ship a polished **web POC** of Challenges that is:  
  - **Production‑lean**: Clean architecture, typed interfaces, test coverage, infra ready to scale.  

  - **Playable end‑to‑end**: login → link wallets/accounts → join → play → leaderboard → payout.  

  - **Multi‑chain aware**: EVM first (Abstract), with adapters for Solana tokens later.  

  - **Admin tools**: Create/edit challenges; operational views for support & payouts.  

- Respect existing **Pulse tournament rules**: fees, Top‑12 splits, cancellations, fallbacks.  

- Design with **wallet‑app expansion** in mind (future Pulse Wallet features).  

### **1.2 Non‑Goals (v0/v1)**

- Native iOS/Android apps (we’ll keep the codebase portable to mobile later).  

- Full push notification service (we’ll implement rich in‑app toasts; push later).  

- On‑chain anti‑cheat or trustless oracles (we’ll use signed server telemetry; oracle vendors evaluated).  

- Marketplace features, chat/DMs, staking, or brand‑sponsored escalator mechanics (future phases).  

## **2) System Architecture**

### **2.1 High‑Level Diagram**

- **Next.js App Router** on Vercel (SSR + ISR for SEO pages; mostly client‑side for app shell).  

- **Privy React SDK**: Auth + wallets (embedded + external) for **EVM (Abstract)** and **Solana** (Phantom et al.).  

- **EVM RPC**: Abstract mainnet/testnet via RPC endpoints; viem/wagmi for EVM calls.  

- **Contracts layer**: TEP integration for escrow/payouts. Fallback: our audited EVM tournament escrow + 0xSplits for fee distribution.  

- **Backend API**: Next.js API routes or a lightweight Node service for:  
  - challenge CRUD (admin),  

  - join/pay flow (intent checks, allowance/permit flows),  

  - leaderboard ingestion from **Pudgy Party** server webhooks,  

  - payouts orchestration and post‑settlement accounting.  

- **DB**: Postgres (Neon), Prisma ORM.  

- **Cache/Real‑time**: Redis (Upstash) + WebSockets (Vercel WebSockets/Ably/Pusher).  

- **Telemetry**: Snowplow JS + server emitters → BigQuery → Looker dashboards.  

- **Images**: LLM image gen service (OpenAI image API) with prompt guardrails + review queue.  

### **2.2 Environments**

- **Dev** (preview branches); **Staging**; **Prod**.  

- Automatic Vercel previews per PR; feature flags via @vercel/flags or ConfigCat.  

## **3) Authentication & Account Linking**

### **3.1 Login Methods**

- Enable: **Email OTP**, **Passkey/WebAuthn**, **Discord**, **Google**, **Wallet (SIWE/SIWS)**.  

- Progressive onboarding: allow browse → prompt to authenticate at join/payout actions.  

### **3.2 User Object & Linking**

- Single user may attach: **many wallets** (EVM + Solana), **one email**, **many passkeys**.  

- **Mythical Account linking** (FusionAuth OAuth):  
  - Start link → FusionAuth OAuth consent → redirect back with code → exchange for token → store user↔Mythical mapping with scopes (game stats read).  

  - Unlink revokes token & marks data stale.  

### **3.3 Sessions & Security**

- Privy session token + app JWT for API calls; rotate 24h; refresh on activity.  

- CSRF on POST; rate limits on sensitive endpoints (join/create/payout).  

- Device fingerprint (soft) for risk scoring (suspicious rapid account creation).  

### **3.4 Acceptance Criteria**

- User can login with OTP/Discord/Google, link ≥1 EVM wallet and Phantom, view all under **Profile → Linked Wallets**; sign a test message; export embedded key.  

- Logging out invalidates the app JWT; refresh is required for new actions.

### **3.5 Mythical Account Linking Flow**

**Requirement**: All users must link Mythical account to access challenges (required for scoring/leaderboard data).

**Technical Flow:**

1. **Post-Privy Auth**: After successful Privy login, check if user has linked Mythical account
2. **Blocking Modal**: If not linked, show "Connect Your Game Account" modal (cannot dismiss)
3. **OAuth Initiation**: Click "Connect Mythical" → Redirect to FusionAuth OAuth consent screen
4. **OAuth Scopes**: Request profile:read, gameplay:read for username + match data access
5. **Callback Handling**: /api/mythical/oauth/callback → Exchange code for access token
6. **Profile Fetch**: Call Mythical API to get displayName (Pudgy username, NFL Rivals username, etc.)
7. **Database Storage**: Store mythicalAccountId, displayName, accessToken (encrypted), refreshToken
8. **Unlock App**: User can now access challenge listings and join flows

**Error Handling:**

- OAuth rejection → Show retry modal with support contact
- API failures → Temporary "Try Again" with fallback to support email
- Token expiry → Auto-refresh on webhook failures, re-prompt user if refresh fails

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- New users cannot access challenge listings without Mythical link
- Profile shows linked Mythical username
- Webhook payload matching works via mythicalAccountId
- Unlink option in Profile → clears tokens, blocks app access until re-link  

## **4) Wallets & Chains**

### **4.1 Supported Tokens & Networks**

**Supported Tokens (Entry Fees & Prizes):**

- **MYTH**: Abstract L2, Ethereum Mainnet
- **PENGU**: Abstract L2, Solana
- **USDC**: Abstract L2, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche
- **ETH**: Ethereum Mainnet, Abstract L2
- **SOL**: Solana

**Network Support:**

- **EVM Networks**: Abstract L2 (primary), Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche
- **Non-EVM**: Solana

**Price Display Requirements:**

- All token amounts must show USD equivalent
- Live price updates every 1 minute via CoinGecko API
- Format: "10 MYTH (~$45.67 USD)" throughout UI
- Cache prices server-side with 60-second TTL

### **4.2 Wallet Types**

- **Embedded EVM wallet** (Privy) auto‑provisioned on login (configurable) with **key export** in **Profile**.  

- **External EVM wallets**: MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet via connectors.  

- **Solana wallets**: Phantom et al. (link for holding/prizes; writes post‑MVP if required).  

### **4.3 Preferred Payout Wallets**

- In **Profile → Payouts**, user selects **preferred wallet per network** (EVM/Abstract; Solana).  

- If unset, default to embedded EVM wallet on Abstract for MYTH payouts. Solana payouts require Phantom linked.  

### **4.4 Multi-Network Wallet Support**

**Challenge Network Compatibility:**

- Each challenge specifies required network (e.g., "Abstract L2" for MYTH entry)
- Join flow checks if user's preferred payout wallet supports challenge network

**Wallet-Network Mismatch Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Preferred wallet doesn't support challenge network**

- Show wallet switcher filtered to compatible wallets only
- If no compatible wallets linked: Prompt "Connect \[Network\] Wallet" → Privy connector flow
- Fallback: Use embedded wallet (supports all EVM networks via RPC switching)

**Scenario 2: External wallet on wrong network**

- Show "Switch to \[Correct Network\]" button → Triggers Privy network switching
- If wallet doesn't support network: Prompt to use different wallet or embedded wallet

**Network Display Rules:**

- Challenge cards show network badge (e.g., "Abstract L2", "Solana")
- Entry fee displays include network: "10 MYTH on Abstract L2"
- Wallet selector shows network compatibility: "MetaMask ✓ Abstract" vs "MetaMask ✗ Solana"

**Acceptance Criteria**: Users can always join challenges regardless of wallet/network mismatches through guided flows

### **Supported Token ↔ Network Combos**

- **MYTH:** Abstract L2, Ethereum Mainnet  

- **PENGU:** Abstract L2, Solana  

- **USDC:** Abstract L2, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche  

- **ETH:** Ethereum Mainnet, Abstract L2  

- **SOL:** Solana  

### **6.2 Validation**

- Entry fees & prize tokens must be whitelisted (admin list).
- Start < End; min duration 30m;
- When **Token** changes, **Network** must be re-validated (and reset if incompatible).
- **Entry Fee Amount** and **Sponsor Prize Amount** inputs show the selected token symbol and allow decimals appropriate for that token.
- The **Prize Pool** displayed to users = _Sponsor Prize Amount_ + _Σ(Entry Fees)_ − fees (game-dev fee, organizer fee as applicable).
- **Game Mode** + **Score By** apply only to the selected **Game** (here: Pudgy Party).
- Organizer fee range 0–10% (enforced by UI & server).  

### **6.3 Smart Contract Hooks (EVM v0)**

- On **Publish**:  
    1. Create tournament object off‑chain (DB) with status UPCOMING.  

    2. Initialize **escrow contract** via TEP (or our EVM contract) with: entry token addr, min fee, fee split config, payout recipients resolver (we provide winners post‑end). Store escrowAddress + escrowId.
- Store contract deployment/interaction gas estimates for user display

### **6.4 Acceptance Criteria**

- Admin can create/publish; a view page exists; contract init succeeds on Abstract testnet; errors roll back server state.

### **6.5 Challenge Editing Permissions**

**Always Editable (Admin only):**

- Challenge description
- Hero image

**Editable Until First Participant Joins:**

- Title, start/end times, entry fee amount, prize token configuration, max participants, organizer fee percentage, visibility settings

**Never Editable After Publishing:**

- Game selection, game mode selection, scoring method (score_by), entry token/network, escrow contract references

**State-Based Restrictions:**

- **DRAFT**: All fields editable
- **UPCOMING** (no participants): Limited editing allowed
- **UPCOMING** (≥1 participant): Only description/image editable
- **LIVE/ENDED/SETTLED**: Read-only  

## **7) Join Flow (Entry Fee & Lock‑in)**

### **7.1 UX**

- **Join drawer** shows: Entry Fee, Token/Network, Prize Pool estimate, Fees (Dev + Organizer), Deadline, and **Selected Wallet** (switcher).  

- **First‑time**: prompt to link wallet(s); otherwise default to user’s preferred EVM wallet.  

### **7.2 On‑chain Steps (EVM)**

- For ERC‑20 entry:  
  - Estimate gas costs for approve + join transaction → Display total cost (entry fee + estimated gas) to user→ Check allowance → trigger **approve** (or permit if supported) → **deposit** into escrow join(tournamentId).  

- Record on server: join_tx_hash, participant link.  

### **7.3 Cancel & Refund Rules**

- Auto‑cancel if ≤3 participants by cutoff; refund 100% (minus network fees).  

- If 4–11 participants, distribute prize pot to top N per fallback logic (below), after fees.  

### **7.4 Gas Estimation & Cost Display**

**Pre-Transaction Gas Estimates:**

1. **ERC-20 Approval**: Use eth_estimateGas for approve(spender, amount) call
2. **Join Transaction**: Estimate gas for join(tournamentId) contract call
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Entry fee + (gas estimate × current gas price)
4. **Gas Price Source**: Network's suggested gas price (fast/standard tier)

**UI Display in Join Drawer:**

- ****Entry Fee: 10 MYTH (~$45.00)
- Network Fee: ~0.002 ETH (~$6.40)
- ────────────────────────────

Total Cost: ~$51.40

**Dynamic Updates:**

- Refresh gas estimates every 30 seconds while drawer is open
- Show "Estimating..." state during calculation
- Warning if gas price spikes >50% from initial estimate

**Error Handling:**

- Gas estimation failures → Show "Gas estimate unavailable, proceed with caution"
- Network congestion → Display "High network activity, consider waiting"
- Insufficient gas token → "Insufficient ETH for transaction fees" with "Add Funds" link

**Acceptance Criteria**: Users see accurate total costs before signing, gas failures don't block transactions  

## **8) Leaderboards & Scoring (Pudgy Party v0)**

### **8.1 Modes**

- **Top‑1 Finishes** – count of 1st place finishes in the time window.  

- **Top‑3 Finishes** – count of top‑3 placements.  

- **Top‑10 Finishes** – count of top‑10 placements.  

- **Coins Earned** – sum of in‑match coins.

**8.1a Game & Scoring**

Game: All challenges use \`PUDGY_PARTY\` game type

Challenge Titles: Should reflect Pudgy Party gameplay modes rather than other game names

Examples: "Pudgy Ice Sprint Challenge", "Penguin Coin Rush Tournament", "Arctic Victory Challenge"

### **8.2 Data Ingestion**

- **Primary**: Pudgy Party **server → webhook** to Challenges API with signed JWT (shared secret/rotating keys). Payload includes mythicalAccountId, matchId, placements\[\], coins, timestamp.
- **Authentication & Mapping:**
  - **Webhook Security**: Shared secret HMAC signature verification + rotating JWT tokens
  - **Payload Validation**: Verify challengeId exists and is in LIVE state
  - **User Mapping**: mythicalAccountId from webhook → lookup linked Pulse user via OAuth mapping table
  - **Username Validation**: Cross-reference webhook mythicalAccountId with stored displayName for audit trail
- **Idempotency & Deduplication:**
  - **Match ID Uniqueness**: matchId serves as idempotency key per challenge
  - **Upsert Logic**: New match → insert; duplicate matchId → update existing aggregates
  - **Score Reconciliation**: Handle out-of-order webhook delivery with timestamp-based conflict resolution
- **Latency**: ≤ 10 seconds typical; interim UI shows "Pending updates…".
- **Webhook retry policy:** "Retry policy: exponential backoff up to 5 attempts over 30 minutes for failed webhook deliveries"

### **8.3 Anti‑tamper**

- Only server‑signed events are accepted; optional score caps per window; anomaly detection (e.g., > X firsts per hour) flags review.  

### **8.4 Acceptance Criteria**

- Leaderboard updates in near‑real time; ties broken by earliest achievement; downloadable CSV; winner preview matches the final payout set.  

## **9) Payouts & Settlement**

### **9.1 Fee Model**

- **Developer fee**: default **8%** of **total entry pool**, configurable per challenge by admin within policy.  

- **Organizer fee**: **0–10%** configurable per challenge.  

- Fees are taken **before** player payouts.  

### **9.2 Payout Logic & Distribution**

**Fee Calculation (Applied First):**

- **Developer Fee**: 8% of total entry pool
- **Organizer Fee**: 0-10% of total entry pool (set during creation)
- **Net Prize Pool (P)**: Total entries - dev fee - organizer fee

**Cancellation Rules:**

- **≤3 participants**: Auto-cancel 30 minutes before end
- **Full refunds**: 100% entry fees returned, zero fees collected
- **UI Message**: "Challenge cancelled due to insufficient participation"

**Standard Distribution (12+ participants):**

- Use Top-12 percentage table from net prize pool (P)
- **Minimum guarantee**: Ranks 7-12 receive at least full entry fee refund
- **Holds true as long as total fees < 50%**

**Low Participation (4-11 participants):**

1. Apply Top-12 percentages to actual participant count
2. Calculate unallocated percentage from unfilled ranks (7-12)
3. Redistribute unallocated amount evenly across all actual ranks
4. **Example (6 participants, 1000 MYTH net pool)**:
    - Standard allocation: 1st=450, 2nd=180, 3rd=100, 4th-6th=50 each
    - Total allocated: 880 MYTH
    - Unallocated: 120 MYTH (from ranks 7-12)
    - Redistribution: +20 MYTH to each rank
    - **Final**: 1st=470, 2nd=200, 3rd=120, 4th-6th=70 each

### **9.3 Prize Types**

- **ERC‑20/SPL** prize pool (always to rank‑1)

### **9.4 Payout Execution (EVM v0)**

- At **END**:  
    1. Server computes winners & shares; obtains admin review.  

    2. Server calls TEP (or our escrow): settle(tournamentId, winners\[\], amounts\[\], feeRecipients\[\]) from operator.  

    3. Contract emits Payout events; UI updates state to **SETTLED**.  

- User receives tokens to **preferred payout wallet** for that network.
- Fallback: If preferred payout wallet fails (insufficient gas, blacklisted), attempt payout to embedded wallet with user notification  

### **9.5 Acceptance Criteria**

- Payout tx shown on challenge page & profile; fee receipts recorded; handle revert paths (insufficient liquidity, paused token) with retry queue.

### **9.6 Token Matching Requirements**

**Simplified Rule**: Entry token and prize token MUST be identical (same token contract, same network)

**Rationale**: Eliminates cross-chain bridging complexity, token conversion rates, and liquidity management

**Examples:**

- ✅ Valid: Entry = 10 MYTH on Abstract, Prize Pool = MYTH on Abstract
- ✅ Valid: Entry = 5 PENGU on Solana, Prize Pool = PENGU on Solana
- ❌ Invalid: Entry = MYTH on Abstract, Prize = PENGU on Solana
- ❌ Invalid: Entry = USDC on Ethereum, Prize = USDC on Polygon

**Challenge Creation Validation**:

- Prize token field auto-populates to match entry token selection
- Prize token field is read-only (cannot be changed independently)
- UI shows: "Prize Pool: Paid in \[ENTRY_TOKEN\] on \[NETWORK\]"

**Acceptance Criteria**: All challenges have matching entry/prize tokens, creation form enforces this rule, no cross-chain conversion needed  

## **10) Token Prices & Display**

**Primary Price Source**: CoinGecko API (server-side cached, 60s TTL)

**Fallback Strategy (CoinGecko failures):**

1. **Stale Cache**: Extend cached prices up to 5 minutes with "Price may be outdated" disclaimer
2. **Secondary API**: CoinMarketCap API as backup (30-second delay between attempts)
3. **Graceful Degradation**: If all APIs fail, show token amounts only with "(USD unavailable)" label

**Display Format**: "10 MYTH (~$5.67 USD)" with price source indicator when using fallbacks

**Acceptance Criteria**: Price failures don't block core functionality, clear user messaging about data freshness

## **11) Notifications (In‑App Toasters)**

### **11.1 Design Principles**

- **Short, punchy, gamified**; clear primary CTA; respect rate limits.  

### **11.2 MVP Notifications**

See Challenge Related Notifications to be included: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pn1KQe8sQXpYsyjlWEKEwIa315m_wnkbVXUvd-byeqQ/edit?usp=sharing>

- Terms/Privacy hosted on **mythical.games** or **pulse.xyz** per org policy; in‑app surfaces link at sign‑up and join.  

- Regional restrictions and age gating TBD; organizer fee disclosures on join screen.  

- No gambling/wagering verbiage; “entry fees” and “skill competition.”  

## **14) Telemetry & Analytics (Snowplow)**

### **14.1 Core KPIs**

- Funnel: **signup → link Mythical → link wallet → join → place (ranked) → payout**.  

- Engagement: D1/D7/D30 retention; **active challenges joined/created**; **LLM image attach rate**.  

- Monetization: total entry volume by token/chain; dev/organizer fees; payout velocity.  

### **14.2 Event Schema (selected)**

- auth_login_started { method }  

- auth_login_succeeded { method, hasEmbeddedWallet }  

- wallet_linked { chain, wallet_type, is_default }  

- mythical_linked { scopes }

- challenge_join_started { id, token, fee }  

- challenge_join_confirmed { id, tx_hash, wallet }  

- leaderboard_update { id, score_by, delta }  

- payout_settled { id, winners: \[{rank, amount, wallet}\], dev_fee, org_fee }
- Page views on each page  

- All tracked with user_id and session context; PII minimized.  

## **15) Detailed Flows**

### **15.1 Sign Up / Sign In (Privy Integration)**

**Supported Login Methods:**

- **Email OTP** (Privy native)
- **SMS OTP** (Privy native)
- **Social SSO**: Apple, Google, Discord
- **External Wallets**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Rainbow, Phantom
- **Passkey/WebAuthn** (Privy native)
- **MFA Support** (Privy native, post-login)

**Flow:**

1. User lands on home page (browsable without auth)
2. Click **Sign In** → Privy modal opens with method selection
3. **First-time users**: Choose method → complete auth → Privy auto-provisions embedded EVM wallet
4. **Returning users**: Sign in → access existing linked wallets/accounts
5. **Post-auth**: Route to Challenges Home with user pill modal in nav/drawer displaying embedded privy wallet address
6. **Progressive onboarding**: Prompt for additional wallet linking and Mythical Account connection (Mythical account connection required, wallet linking optional, as Privy auto-provisions a privy wallet)

**Privy Cross-App Ecosystem Integration:**

- Enable "Log in to Abstract" flow for Abstract L2 ecosystem wallets
- Support cross-app wallet sharing within Privy ecosystem
- Maintain wallet state across supported dApps

**Terms & Privacy:**

- Privy handles terms acceptance during signup flow
- Link to mythical.games/pulse.xyz privacy policy as required

**Edge Cases:**

- In-app browser OAuth fallback to OTP/SMS
- Wallet connection failures → retry with guidance
- Show Privy's native error handling UX

### **15.2 Profile Settings & Account Management (Privy UI)**

**Leverage Privy's existing UI screens for:**

- **Linked Accounts**: View/manage social logins (Apple, Google, Discord)
- **Security**: MFA setup, passkey management, password changes
- **Wallets**: View linked external wallets, export embedded wallet private key
- **Sessions**: Active device management, logout options

**Custom Pulse Settings (our UI):**

- **Preferred Payout Wallets**: Set default per network (EVM/Abstract, Solana)
- **Notifications**: Opt-in/out of toast notifications per event type
- **Mythical Account Linking**: Connect/disconnect OAuth integration

### **15.3 Join Challenge Flow (Transaction Signing)**

**Wallet Selection:**

1. User clicks **Join** on challenge detail page
2. **Join Drawer** shows: Entry fee, token/network, total cost estimate, selected wallet switcher
3. **Wallet Options**: All linked wallets (embedded + external) for the challenge's network
4. **Default**: User's preferred payout wallet for that network; fallback to embedded wallet

**External Wallet Flow (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.):**

1. Select external wallet → Privy triggers wallet connection
2. Check token balance + allowance for entry fee
3. If insufficient allowance: Request **approve** transaction → user signs in wallet
4. Request **join/deposit** transaction → user signs in wallet
5. Both transactions show gas estimates in wallet UI

**Embedded Wallet Flow (Privy):**

1. Select embedded wallet → Privy handles internally
2. Check balance/allowance (same logic)
3. Privy's embedded wallet UI for transaction approval
4. User confirms via Privy's secure signing flow (biometric/PIN if configured)

**Abstract L2 Integration:**

- Support Privy's "Sign with Abstract" functionality
- Display Abstract network-specific gas estimates
- Handle Abstract L2 RPC calls via Privy connectors

**Error Handling:**

- Insufficient balance → Show "Add Funds" options or wallet switcher
- Transaction rejected → Retry guidance with clear error messaging
- Network switching prompts via Privy's network management

### **15.4 Challenge Creation & Contract Integration**

**Pre-Publishing (DRAFT state):**

1. Admin completes creation form → Save as DRAFT
2. No contract interaction yet
3. All fields remain editable

**Publishing Flow:**

1. Admin clicks **Publish** → Triggers contract deployment
2. **TEP Integration**: Call createTournament(config) → Returns escrowId and escrowAddress
3. Store contract references in database
4. Update challenge state: DRAFT → UPCOMING
5. **Configuration Lock**: Once first participant joins, challenge config becomes immutable

**Contract Association:**

- Each published challenge maps to unique escrow contract instance
- Entry fees flow to challenge-specific escrow address
- Settlement calls reference escrowId for payout distribution

### **15.5 End & Settlement**

**Auto-Cancellation (≤3 participants):**

1. Check participant count 30 minutes before end
2. If ≤3 participants: Auto-cancel → Full refunds via cancel(escrowId)
3. UI notification: "Challenge cancelled - entry fees refunded"

**Normal Settlement (4+ participants):**

1. Challenge ends → Ingest final scores → Compute rankings
2. **Admin Review**: Preview winners & payout amounts
3. **Calculate Fees**: 8% dev + 0-10% organizer from total entry pool
4. **Apply Payout Logic**:
    - 4-11 participants: Use simplified redistribution (see detailed math below)
    - 12+ participants: Standard Top-12 split
5. **Contract Settlement**: Call settle(escrowId, winners\[\], amounts\[\], feeRecipients\[\])
6. **Payout Execution**: Tokens sent to users' preferred payout wallets
7. **UI Updates**: Show "SETTLED" state with transaction links

## **16) Third‑Party Tournament Escrow Provider (TEP) — Interface Requirements**

We will evaluate providers that support **EVM (Abstract)** now and **Solana** next. If none satisfy both, we ship our own audited EVM contract now, and integrate a Solana program later.

**Must‑have API (conceptual):**

- createTournament(config) → escrowId, escrowAddress  

- join(escrowId, participant, amount) (ERC‑20 approve/permit supported)  

- cancel(escrowId) → refunds all deposits  

- settle(escrowId, winners\[\], amounts\[\], feeRecipients\[\])  

- Events: Joined, Cancelled, Settled
- Query methods:
  - getTournamentState(escrowId) → state, participants, totalDeposits
  - getParticipantDeposit(escrowId, participant) → amount, timestamp

**Contract semantics:**

- Token‑agnostic (any ERC‑20); supports dynamic fee split recipients; safe math; reentrancy guards.  

- Admin/owner role for **operator** (Pulse) to trigger settle.  

- Pluggable **oracle hook** later for trustless result attestation.  

**If building in‑house (EVM v0):**

- Minimal TournamentEscrow + PrizeDistributor + **0xSplits** for dev/org fees.  

- Add **Chainlink Automation** to guard settle windows; **EAS** attestations for result proofs later.  

## **17) LLM Image Generation (Challenge Banners)**

- Prompt template swaps **NFL** assets for **Pudgy** style: cute arctic settings, celebratory confetti, abstracted jerseys with **no logos or numbers**, penguin mascots in generic gear; mobile‑safe focal point; text‑free images.  

- Admin preview & approve; fallback to a fixed safe set if model outputs fail policy checks.  

**Prompt scaffold (example):**

“Create a dynamic, colorful banner for a **Pudgy Party** mobile game challenge titled ‘**Icy Sprint**’. Show cheerful, stylized penguin characters racing through a winter obstacle course with balloons, confetti, and glowing coin pickups. Avoid real logos, team branding, numbers, faces, or athletes. Keep composition center‑weighted for a 16:9 mobile banner. No text.”

## **18) UI/UX — Screens & Components**

### **18.1 Tech Stack & Libraries**

- **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, **shadcn/ui**, **framer‑motion**, **wagmi/viem**, **Privy React SDK**.  

### **18.2 Global**

- App shell with sticky bottom nav (mobile): **Home**, **My Challenges**, **Create** (admin), **Profile**.  

- Theme: dark; subtle glass blur; rounded‑2xl; micro‑interactions on actions (join/settle).  

### **18.3 Home / Listings**

- Sections: Active, Happening Now, Upcoming.  

- Cards show: hero, title, game tag, time status, entry token/network + fee, prize pool (with USD est), joined indicator.  

### **18.4 Challenge Detail**

- Tabs: **Overview**, **Leaderboard**, **Rules**.  

- Overview shows: time remaining, entry details, fees disclosure (Fees: 8% Dev + up to 10% Organizer), prize pool calculator, **Join** CTA.  

- Leaderboard: top ranks with sticky your‑rank row; live deltas.  

### **18.5 Create/Edit (Admin)**

- Multi‑step wizard: Basics → Tokens & Fees → Schedule → Review.  

- Token selectors filtered by chain; validation on decimals/minimums.  

### **18.6 Profile**

- **Linked Accounts** (Mythical, Discord/Google), **Linked Wallets** (EVM/Solana), **Preferred Payouts**, **Export Embedded Key**, **Notifications** opt‑in/opt‑out.  

### **18.7 Microcopy (concise)**

- Prize pool note on Overview: “**MYTH prize pool** is funded by entry fees. Dev (8%) & Organizer (up to 10%) fees are deducted before payouts.”  

## **19) APIs & Data Contracts**

### **19.1 Public API (server routes)**

- POST /api/auth/webhook – Privy auth webhooks (user created/linked/unlinked)  

- POST /api/mythical/oauth/callback – link exchange  

- POST /api/challenges – admin create  

- POST /api/challenges/{id}/publish – create escrow + set UPCOMING  

- POST /api/challenges/{id}/join – record intent; return contract calldata; server signs permit if applicable  

- POST /api/challenges/{id}/settle – admin settle (payouts)  

- POST /api/pudgy/webhook – signed game events  

### **19.2 Webhook (Pudgy → Pulse)**

****{

"id": "evt_123",

"version": "1.0", // Schema version for backward compatibility

## **20) Fee & Payout Math (Deterministic)**

Given:

- E = sum(entry_fees)  

- dev = E \* devFeeBps/10_000  

- org = E \* orgFeeBps/10_000  

- P = E - dev - org  

Top‑12 weights W = \[45,18,10,5,5,5,2,2,2,2,2,2\] → normalized shares.  
If participants ≤ 3 → cancel & refund.  
If 4 ≤ participants < 12 → let R = participants; distribute P using the first R weights from the Top-12 table, then redistribute the remaining weight sum equally among those R positions (equal split across filled ranks).

**Precision:** Use integer math in token minimal units; only rounding down to avoid over‑distribution; leftovers (< 1 unit per token) accrue to a designated sink (dev wallet) or are redistributed to rank‑1.

## **21) Edge Cases & Fallbacks**

- Wallet rejected or insufficient allowance → show guided retry.  

- Token paused/blacklisted → block join; surface error.  

- Webhook outages → pause leaderboard updates; show timestamp of last update; allow manual upload CSV by admin for emergency settle (admin‑only).  

- Image gen fail → fallback to curated banner set.  

## **22) Performance & SLOs**

- P95 route latency < 300ms (cached) / < 800ms (uncached).  

- Leaderboard update fan‑out < 3s to clients.  

- Join throughput: 50 TPS burst (queued/signature gating), 500 concurrent users browsing.  

## **23) Security Checklist**

- Strict Content Security Policy; isolate wallet iframes; same‑site cookies Lax; JWT exp ≤ 24h.  

- Reentrancy & checks‑effects‑interactions in any owned contracts; pause/guardian role.  

- Admin actions require 2FA + audit log.  

## **24) Instrumentation & Observability**

- Snowplow events as above; Sentry errors (frontend/backend); Log drains to Datadog.  

- Health endpoints + synthetic join/settle tests on cron.  

## **25) Rollout Plan**

- **Phase A (v0 POC)**: Abstract testnet; embedded wallets; admin‑only create; MYTH test token; end‑to‑end join→settle.  

- **Phase B**: Abstract mainnet; external wallets; MYTH on Abstract; production payouts; Pudgy ingested telemetry; image gen gating.  

- **Phase C**: Solana adapter for PENGU (Phantom payouts), cross‑chain token selector; oracle/attestation option.  

## **26) Implementation Tasks (Jira‑ready excerpts)**

Use these as templates; break down further as needed. Each task has **User Story**, **Description**, **Tech Spec**, **Acceptance Criteria**.

**PCH‑A2 — External Wallet Linking (EVM & Solana)**

- **Story:** As a user, I can link MetaMask and Phantom to my account.  

- **Spec:** Enable connectors, UI for link/unlink; show addresses under Profile.  

- **AC:** Link/unlink flows succeed; multiple wallets are shown; active wallet switcher on join.  

**PCH‑A3 — Preferred Payout Wallets**

- **Story:** I can set default payout wallets per network.  

- **Spec:** DB WalletPref; Profile UI; server validates address checksums.  

- **AC:** Payouts use selected wallet; update persists across sessions.  

**PCH‑A4 — Mythical OAuth Link**

- **Story:** I can link my Mythical account for scoring.  

- **Spec:** OAuth code grant; tokens stored encrypted; mapping table.  

- **AC:** Linked state shown; unlink revokes; webhook from Pudgy resolves to my user.  

### **26.2 Challenges & Contracts**

**PCH‑C1 — Challenge CRUD (Admin)**

- **Story:** Admin can create/edit/publish challenges.  

- **Spec:** Form wizard; validation; publish triggers escrow init (TEP stub).  

- **AC:** Challenge visible in listings; state transitions valid.  

**PCH‑C2 — Join Flow (EVM)**

- **Story:** I can pay the entry fee and join.  

- **Spec:** Allowance check, approve/permit → join; server records tx.  

- **AC:** User shows as participant; on‑chain join event present; UI success toast.  

**PCH‑C3 — Payout & Settle**

- **Story:** Admin can settle and winners get paid.  

- **Spec:** Compute shares; call TEP settle; write payout receipts.  

- **AC:** Winners’ wallets receive tokens; fees routed; explorer links shown.  

### **26.3 Leaderboards & Telemetry**

**PCH‑L1 — Pudgy Webhook Ingestion**

- **Story:** Scores update in near real‑time.  

- **Spec:** Signed JWT webhook; idempotent upsert; aggregate by challenge/time window & metric.  

- **AC:** Live leaderboard updates; replay safe.  

**PCH‑L2 — Snowplow Schema & Emitters**

- **Story:** Product can analyze conversion & payouts.  

- **Spec:** Implement events; context schema; server‑side forwarding for sensitive events.  

- **AC:** Dashboard shows funnel; sample data validated.  

### **26.4 Images & UI**

**PCH‑I1 — LLM Banner Generation + Review Queue**

- **Story:** Admin can generate/approve a safe banner per challenge.  

- **Spec:** Prompt templates; moderation checks; asset CDN.  

- **AC:** Approved image attaches; fallback on failure.  

**PCH‑U1 — Gamified Toasts**

- **Story:** I get delightful, timely nudges.  

- **Spec:** Toast queue with rate limit; standardized variants; deeplinks.  

- **AC:** Toasters appear per triggers; a11y & motion‑reduced variants.  

## **27) Open Questions**

- Preferred **TEP** candidates for EVM+Solana? If none, green‑light in‑house EVM escrow now + Solana program later.  

- Regulatory review for multi‑region token entry fees; any blocked geos?  

- Who owns dev fee wallet(s) and revenue accounting flow?  

- Final domain policy (mythical.games vs pulse.xyz) for Terms/Privacy links.  

## **28) Risks & Mitigations**

- **Multi‑chain complexity** → Stage Solana integration; start EVM on Abstract first.  

- **Oracle/trust** → Use server‑signed telemetry initially; plan oracle vendor RFP.  

- **Fraud/abuse** → Rate limits, anomaly detection, admin reviews, capped entries/user.  

- **Token volatility** → Price display is informational; payouts based on token amounts.  

## **29) Glossary (A–Z)**

## **0xSplits** — On-chain protocol that splits incoming funds (ETH/ERC‑20) to multiple recipients based on fixed percentages. Useful for automatically routing **Developer** and **Organizer** fees during settlement

## **Account Abstraction (AA, ERC‑4337)** — A framework that lets **smart‑contract wallets** behave like normal accounts. Enables features like **gas sponsorship** (Paymasters), **bundled actions**, and **social recovery** using a new transaction type called a **UserOperation** handled by **Bundlers**
